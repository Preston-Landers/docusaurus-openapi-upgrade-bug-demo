    UserModifiableFields:
      type: object
      description: |
        These are fields in the User object that can be modified (not necessarily by the user in question)
        or given as input when creating a new User.

        :::tip

        Note that only `user_login` and `fullname` are required when creating a new User.

        :::

        **Note:** If using SSO (Single Sign-On), the `user_login` field usually
        needs to match the user's email address, UPN, or other primary identifier in
        the external authentication system.

        :::warning

        The `new_pw`, `new_pw2`, and `expire_new_pw` fields should only be used when
        intending to change the user's password.
