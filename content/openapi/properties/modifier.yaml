      type: object
      description: |
        Fields related to the last modification of a resource, including the
        last modified timestamp in various formats, the modifier's user ID and
        full name. Please note that this only records the most recent
        modification. In addition, it may not reflect modifications to child
        resources or extended properties that are defined in other tables, such
        as "Custom Fields". These last modifier fields are always read-only.

        Note that extended information about the modifier user may be included
        in the `modifier_properties` field, depending on the `$keys` requested.
        If present, this information will follow the schema of the
        [User](/docs/reference/schemas/user) object.

        # This is how we can attach properties like nullable and a custom description
        # while still using a `$ref` under OpenAPI 3.0.  It appears to be a bit different
        # under OpenAPI 3.1 which our current toolset doesn't seem to support yet anyway.

        # TODO: that wasn't really working, had to remove nullable here.
