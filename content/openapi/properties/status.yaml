      description: |
        These are common fields used throughout the system to indicate the status
        of an object, whether "hidden", "loggable", "reportable-only".

        Note that "hidden" status is defined as not belonging to any
        [Groups](/docs/reference/schemas/groupfields). See that link
        for more information about finding hidden items.

        Loggable and Reportable status means that the object is both visible
        to at least some users, and can be used in current (new) time entries.

        Reportable Only means that the object is visible to at least some users,
        but cannot be used in newly created time entries.
      properties:
        is_hidden:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Indicates whether the object is hidden.

        hidden:
          type: boolean

          description: |
            The general visibility status of the object;
            either `Hidden`, `Loggable and Reportable`, or `Reportable Only`.

            This is a write-enabled field if you have the appropriate permissions.
            See also `status_code` which can be changed in the same way.
