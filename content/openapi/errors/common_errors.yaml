BadRequest:
  description: |
    A `400 Bad Request` is returned when the client request was malformed,
    invalid, or otherwise could not be processed as-is. Usually, the cause for
    the error is included in the `error.message` field of the response, and the
    client should correct the request and try again.

      # examples:

# 403 - Forbidden (not authorized)
NotAuthorized:
  description: |
    A `403 Forbidden` response means that you are not authorized to perform
    this action or access this object, or the object does not exist at all.

    The client request may have been valid but the client does not have
    permission to access the requested resource or perform the requested action.

    :::tip 403 Forbidden also used when objects don't exist

    In most cases, the system will not return a `404 Not Found` error response;
    it returns `403 Forbidden` both when the object doesn't exist at all,
    and also when it exists but the client does not have permission to access it.
    This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized users from determining
    whether an object exists or not.

# 404 - Not found
# Note: most endpoints actually do NOT return a 404 error response, but return
# a 403 Forbidden response instead. However, there may still be certain
# cases where a 404 response is returned, so it's included here.
NotFound:
  description: |
    Not found - the requested resource could not be found or does not exist.
    This may also include cases where the resource does exist, but the client
    does not have permission to access that resource.

    :::tip 403 Forbidden also used when objects don't exist

    In most cases, the system will not return a `404 Not Found` error response;
    it returns `403 Forbidden` both when the object doesn't exist at all,
    and also when it exists but the client does not have permission to access it.

# 500 - Internal server error
InternalServerError:
  description: |
    Internal server error; an unexpected error occurred on the server. This
    could be due to a temporary condition or might be the result of a bug in the
    server software. Also, in some cases, an incorrect client input can
    trigger this error, and can be resolved by correcting the input.

    If the error persists, please contact support along along with the following
    details when possible:

    - any error messages received from the server
    - the full request and response details (full headers and body)
    - a description of the steps that led to the error
    - the time range when it occurred.

# 503 - Service unavailable
