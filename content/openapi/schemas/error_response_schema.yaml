# This defines the common format of all error responses that may be returned by the API.
ErrorResponse:
  description: |
    A standard format for error responses that may be returned by the API when various
    types of errors occur, including authentication (sign-in) failures, authorization
    (permission) failures, "object not found" (404), internal server errors (500),
    bad client requests (400) and other types of errors.
  type: object
  properties:
    error:
      type: object
      description: |
        A detailed error object that includes a code and message for the error
        that occurred. This is useful for client applications to display to
        users or to log for debugging purposes.
      properties:
        code:
          type: string
          description: |
            A short code that identifies the type of error that occurred.
            This helps group related errors into categories for common
            treatment in the user interface or client program.

            Some of the common codes are listed on the
            [Core Concepts#Fixed error codes](/docs/rest-overview#fixed-error-codes)
            page.

          example: NotFoundOrNotAuthorized
        message:
          type: string
          description: |
            A human-readable message that describes the error that occurred.
          example:
            You must be signed in to access this resource. If you are making an
            API call, please check the section of the documentation on
            authentication.
    errors:
      type: array
      description: |
        An array of error messages that may be returned by the server. Usually
        this has the same content as the `error` object's `message` field, but
        this array may contain additional messages or details.
      items:
        type: string
        example:
          You must be signed in to access this resource. If you are making an
          API call, please check the section of the documentation on
          authentication.
    response_code:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The HTTP status code of the response. This is useful for client
        applications to determine the type of error that occurred.
      example: 401
    success:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Indicates whether the request was successful (normally false if it's an
        error response)
      default: false
    traceback:
      type: string
      description: |
        A full traceback of the error that occurred on the server. This is
        useful for debugging and troubleshooting. Note that the traceback is
        only available if the server is in development mode.
      example: |
        Traceback (most recent call last): ... (full traceback)
