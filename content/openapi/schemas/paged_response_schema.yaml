# The following ResultsDesc/description text can be reused as the

# Typical usage:

#   get:
#     summary: List projects
#     responses:
#       "200":
#         description:
#           $ref: "../../schemas/paged_response_schema.yaml#/ResultsDesc/description"

ResultsDesc:
  description: |
    A successful response from a paged collection; see the `results` array in the
    response for the list of results for this page. Additional pages may be
    available and can be fetched using the `@nextLink` URL.

    Note that the examples given may include keys (fields) that may not always be
    present in the response, depending on the fields requested in the `$keys`
    parameter, the user's permissions, and other system settings.

# This schema is used as the response schema for most collection endpoints.
PagedResponse:
  description: |
    A standard success response that may be returned by the API for most
    collection endpoints. This response includes a list of result objects (items),
    a count of the total number of items matching the query, and other metadata.
  type: object
  properties:
    response_code:
      type: integer
      description: HTTP status code of the response for reference purposes.
      example: 200
      default: 200
    success:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Indicates whether the request was successful (normally `true` if it's
        not an error response).
      default: true
    uri:
      type: string
      description:
        URL of the current request / resource, for reference purposes.
      example: https://example.apps.journyx.com/api/v1/users
    $count:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The total number of items matching the query; not the number of items in
        the current response.
      example: 100
    $skip:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The number of items skipped in the query; in other words, the offset of
        the first item in the current response compared to the total set of
        items in the collection. When used as a query parameter, this is the
        number of items to skip over.
      example: 0
    $top:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The number of items returned in the current response. When used as a
        query parameter, this is the maximum number of items to return.
      example: 10
    "@nextLink":
      type: string
      description: The URL to fetch the next set (page) of results.
      example: https://example.apps.journyx.com/api/v1/users?$top=10&$skip=10
    results:
      type: array
      # description: The list of items in the collection.
      items:
        type: object
        # description: Placeholder for specific collection items.
