      # As far as I can tell, this is currently either being ignored
      # or is not working as expected, because the code samples being
      # generated do not correspond to this list; e.g. Ruby and PowerShell
      # are present but not listed here. Ironically, if you do list PowerShell
      # it says it's an unknown language and that the supported language
      # list is as follows:
      # `lang` can be one of the following only: "curl", "C#", "Go", "Java",
      #    "Java8+Apache", "JavaScript", "Node.js", "PHP", "Python", "R", "Ruby"
